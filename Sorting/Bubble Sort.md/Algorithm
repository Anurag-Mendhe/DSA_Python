# Bubble Sort

It works by "repeatedly swapping the adjecent elements" if they are in the wrong order.
Think of it like "Bubbles rising at the top" - in each pass, the largest element moves to the end of the list

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps of the Algorithm

1. Start from the first element.
2. Compare the current element with the next element.
3. If the current element is greater than the next, swap them.
4. Continue this for every element until the end â†’ now the largest element is at the last position.
5. Repeat the process for the remaining elements (ignoring the last sorted ones).
6. Stop when no swaps are needed (list is sorted).

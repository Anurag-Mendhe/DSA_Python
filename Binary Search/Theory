What is Search ?
Search is a process of finding a specific item or value within a collection of iterms or data
It locates a particular element in a dataset for retrieval, update, or decision making

Types of Search

1. Linear Search
A straightforward approach where each element in the list is checked sequentially untill the target is found or the list ends
Time Complexity : O(n)
Example : Checking the book on a shelf by checking each book one by one.

2. Binary Search
An efficient method for finding an element in a sorted array by "repeatedly dividing the search space in half"
Time Complexity : O(log n)
Example : Looking for a word in a dictionary by opening it to the middle and determining which half to search next.

Binary Search Algorithm:
1. Initialization : Start with two pointers (low and high)
2. Midpoint Calculation : Find the middle element (mid)
3. Comparison : Compare the middle element with the target
4. Narrowing Down : Update / Adjust the search range based on the comparison
